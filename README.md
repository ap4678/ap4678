## ✨ About Me

I’m a student passionate about the intersection of AI, economics, and public impact—especially in the context of emerging markets. As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, I’m working on real-world ML problems that center equity and accessibility.  

Beyond AI, my experiences include conducting scientific research, launching data-driven marketing campaigns, and writing for national publications. I thrive at the intersection of technology, policy, and storytelling—and I’m always excited to learn something new.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🔹 [income-prediction-using-US-census-data](https://github.com/ap4678/IncomePredictionProject/tree/main) *(📌 Pinned Project)*  
Built a binary classifier to predict income levels based on demographic data using logistic regression, decision trees, and SVM.  
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Jupyter  
- **Result:** Achieved ~82% accuracy after optimization.  
- Includes dataset, Jupyter notebooks, visualizations, and full documentation.

### 🔹 [machine-learning-foundations-labs](https://github.com/ap4678/Machine-Learning-Foundations-BTT-/tree/main)  
Contains lab assignments and personal projects from a Machine Learning Foundations course exploring core ML techniques.  
- **Projects include:**  
  1. **Income Classification Model:** Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest; evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and log loss.  
  2. **Regression Model Comparison:** Compared Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Random Forest Regressor using MSE and R².  
  3. **Neural Network Implementation:** Built a feedforward neural network from scratch with NumPy; trained with backpropagation and gradient descent.  
- **Tools:** Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook.

### 🔹 [video-poker](https://github.com/ap4678/Video-Poker/tree/main)  
Implemented a simulation of the classic casino game Video Poker. The program supports betting 1-5 tokens and evaluates hands based on standard poker rankings with corresponding payouts.  
- **Features:** Fair deck shuffling, card replacement mechanics, hand evaluation including pairs, straights, flushes, full houses, and royal flushes.  
- **Tools:** Java (classes for Card, Deck, Game, Player), command-line interface, comprehensive game logic, and test suite.  
- Includes two versions of the game constructor for normal play and testing with specified hands.
