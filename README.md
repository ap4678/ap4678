## ✨ About Me

I’m a student passionate about the intersection of AI, economics, and public impact—especially in the context of emerging markets. As a Break Through Tech AI Fellow, I’m working on real-world ML problems that center equity and accessibility.  

Beyond AI, my experiences include conducting scientific research, launching data-driven marketing campaigns, and writing for national publications. I thrive at the intersection of technology, policy, and storytelling—and I’m always excited to learn something new.
